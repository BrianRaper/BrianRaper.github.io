<p>You can already see that lifted trucks have some real advantages when it comes to going off-road, thanks to the greater clearance they enjoy. Operators should be trained to operate the type of trucks they work on. They should also know the potential risks for each model. Descriptive, task-oriented names (such as side loader, high-lift pallet” forklift) aside, forklifts are often referred to in more colloquial terms.</p>
<p>Some dealers will sell lifted trucks, but you may be more likely to find them through alternative means, like custom shops.

However, statistics show that companies that own their fleets tend to keep their forklifts longer than financially makes sense.</p>
