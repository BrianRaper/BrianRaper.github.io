Not move the truck and remain at the controls at all times, if operating an industrial lift truck with a forklift platform with an employee on the platform. For trucks with tilting forks, the forks shall be horizontal or at full upward tilt, whichever is less stable. If you work in a job that requires you to use a forklift primarily outdoors on natural or uneven terrain, even occasionally or rarely, you need rough terrain forklift training.</p>
<p>Our Lorry Loader training course (HIAB) delivered by Lift A Load Training ensures successful candidates have the basic knowledge and practical skills involved in safely operating a lorry loader. These high performers from brands such as Mitsubishi , Heli , Toyota , Hyster and Yale are ready for any stacking, moving, lifting or handling job you may have, whether indoor or outdoor.</p>

This is important because Ahern has one of the broadest selections of forklifts available on the market.

<p>In addition our finance department has warranties that can give you peace of mind with your new lifted truck. In most instances, renting a forklift makes more sense than buying one. Whenever a truck is equipped with vertical only, or vertical and horizontal travel controls elevatable with the lifting carriage or forks for lifting personnel, the following additional precautions should be taken for the protection of personnel being elevated.</p>
