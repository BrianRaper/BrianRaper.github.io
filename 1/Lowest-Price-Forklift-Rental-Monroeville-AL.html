<h2>Hand Pallet Truck  Monroeville </h2>

First, there are many types of rental forklifts available so do your homework and make sure you get a rental unit well suited to your particular job.</p>

Extendable fork: An extra long fork makes it possible for a narrow aisle forklift double stack pallets, one in front of the other.</p>
<h3>Forklift Accessories Monroeville AL</h3>
<p>We carry new and used forklifts in every major make and model. Our Fork Lift Rental fleet is regularly updated with New Rental Equipment and maintained according to manufacturer's specifications. There are plenty of lift kits available in the market that differ in terms of how much they can raise your pickup. Three-wheel forklift trucks also have models where the operator can either sit down or just stand while operating the truck.</p>
<p>Owning your own fleet of forklifts means you need to spend time and money maintaining them. Four fixed-fork order pickers are ideally suited for picking bulky, oversized items or where extended platforms and industrial carts are used in place of pallets. Rentals often have service and repair costs built into that monthly payment. Built for demanding use, this pallet jack is constructed from all-welded steel components.</p>
<p>At our GMC dealership near Rocky Mount and Goldsboro in Wilson, we offer professional upgraded lifted GMC trucks. Forklifts use rear wheel steering. My "beater" 4WD has a 3" lift kit that gives it about a 10" minimum ground clearance-more than enough clearance to handle some quite nasty trails-but I actually use my 4WD for both work and pleasure in areas where such capability is a necessity.</p>

Remember: you always want to buy a forklift that has a slightly higher load capacity than what you think you will need. The mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets.</p>
