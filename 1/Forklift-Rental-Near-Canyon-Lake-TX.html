In the past most order picking jobs were carried out on ground level to increase the productivity, while stock was replenished to the bottom layer with reach & fork trucks. A typical lift truck uses two power-operated horizontal prongs (forks) that can be raised and lowered for loading, transporting, and unloading goods, particularly goods stacked on wooden pallets.</p>
<p>Some reach trucks have a cab that tilts so that the operator can have a better view of the fork carriage, while others actually have small cameras attached to the carriage. Class VII: Rough terrain forklift trucks - Exclusively for outdoor use, these trucks handle rough terrains such as unimproved construction sites. Pallet trucks are used for unloading and stuffing goods that are delivered on the pallet such as cartons and tinned goods.</p>
