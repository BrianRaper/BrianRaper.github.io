<p>Order picking trucks have a working platform that helps the operator to control the lift. Rating Plate: This is used to inform users of the maximum load a forklift can legally carry. This perk makes rough terrain forklifts ideal for busy construction sites with limited space. With FLC's counterbalance forklift certification, you're covered in case of an accident. You can choose between a body lift kit, a suspension lift kit, and leveling lift kits. This is a testament to the impact that lift truck manufacturers and dealers have on the U.S. economy, says Johnson, and also the critical nature of operator training and safety in the context of the workplace.</p>
<p>Manufacturers have models of rough terrain forklifts with load capacities ranging from 4000 to 10000 lbs. When unloaded, the forklift's center of gravity is right about here. We have 3 & 4 wheel electric sit down forklifts, stand up counterbalanced electric forklifts, propane powered, cushion tire warehouse forklifts, electric order pickers, stackers, rough terrain telehandlers and reach forklifts.</p>

The reach forklift is capable of performing the same types of work as the counterbalance and can be fitted with attachments for special lifting jobs as required. When a 15,500 lb. forklift isn't enough, you'll need a high-capacity cushion forklift to get the job done.</p>
