From forklifts to HGVs, our accredited courses will teach you to become a competent operator, learning practical operating skills, health and safety fundamentals, how to inspect machinery and how to troubleshoot problems.</p>
<p>Some new equipment dealerships may have used forklifts that were part of a trade-in. Sometimes the outriggers on a standard walkie reach truck can get in the way of picking loads up.
