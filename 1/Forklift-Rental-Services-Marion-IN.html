<p>Counterweight - a mass attached to the rear of the forklift truck frame. I'm talking about the unGodly big, oversized tires, mudflaps, etc type of trucks that look completely and utterly ridiculous. Rough terrain forklifts provide a high degree of mobility and safety as well as access to areas that would otherwise be off limits. Featuring big, tractor-style tires that provide plenty of traction to handle even the most challenging outdoor terrain, these rugged trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and used outdoors.</p>
<p>Sharing a chassis with the 7300 series "severe-service" truck, it comes from the factory with a permanent all-wheel drive train, heavy duty anti-lock air drum brakes, and either a 7.6L or 8.7L inline six cylinder turbo diesels.

<p>However, just like a stock vehicle, some components in a lift kit can wear out over time, most notably the shock absorbers Some lift kits include shocks that are radically different from the stock units, meaning that replacing those shocks isn't always as simple as just looking your vehicle up. In this guide, we'll show you how to choose the correct shocks for a truck equipped with a lift kit.</p>
<p>That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>
