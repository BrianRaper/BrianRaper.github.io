Optimize your storage capacity by operating in narrow aisles at high picking levels with Raymond Orderpicker trucks.</p>
<p>Forklifts and lift trucks are an essential part of most construction projects and carry their own set of hazards depending on the vehicle type and the workplace where the truck is used.

Because of the high initial cost, almost all forklifts are either rented or financed.</p>

<p>You may be an expert conventional forklift driver, but it is vital to train on a rough terrain forklift because they handle differently, thus, practice is required to become proficient in operating them for safe driving. Riding or giving rides on forklift or load.

They feature specially-designed lifting carriages and come in two configurations: with mast and with reach.</p>
<p>The forklift is every bit as good as they said it would be. I highly recommend this company. PLS Kits are available for most of the popular vehicle applications and can be completely removed if necessary.
