They work closely with independently-owned equipment rental yards, bringing everything together in one place.</p>
<p>It is imperative that you make a good sound and informed decision to ensure that you purchase the right forklift for the job within your desired budget.

Counterbalance forklifts have no extending arms, giving them the ability to move directly to the load.</p>
