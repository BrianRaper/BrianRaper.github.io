<h3>Used Forklift Dealers Glendive MT</h3>
<p>For off road purposes, lifting a truck is the best way to improve its performance. In terms of volume, the global Pallet Trucks market is estimated to exhibit attractive growth rate over the forecast period. In the past this job was done with either ladders, a dangerous and ineffective solution, or with reach trucks with goods on pallets and blocked aisles. When the operator is done with pallet jack, he or she shouldn't leave the equipment just sitting out anywhere.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>Due to ineffective (or nonexistent) training, many forklift drivers aren't aware of max load capacities, or how to safely navigate their workspace with a heavy load. Our friendly and knowledgable forklift sales staff will do a full site assessment to identify the best new forklift for you. Another place where pallet trucks are very useful and can often be found is in loading docks.</p>
