<p>Powerful performance meets compact design. Trucks with a body lift often have a visible gap between the frame and body, which a lot of people find unsightly. This is due to the fact that a used forklift really has no suspension and it is not possible to maintain tire to ground contact in uneven environments. These fees are based on the length of the time you have your rental. The hand pallet truck lift offers load shifting, lifting and lowering functions.</p>
<p>As the name implies, reach trucks reach‚Äù into racking with an extendable carriage and forks to grab pallets that range from 2,500 to 5,500 lbs. This version is known as a deep-reach lift truck. The choice to lift your truck or not is ultimately going to come down to what you use the vehicle for and what you hope to get out of lifting it. If you are an avid off-roader, then the benefit of higher clearance will probably outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
