Service intervals of 1,000 operating hours mean that trucks operate reliably. Pinch point hazards are also common when operating this type of forklift truck.</p>
<p>A subtype of the warehouse forklift, side loaders are usually found in steel service centers and manufacturing facilities with heavy and bulky items. Ensure that loads on pallets are stable, neat, cross-tied if possible, and evenly distributed. A reach truck looks like a very small type of counterbalance forklift. Lifted cars have the potential to run right over smaller vehicles in the event of a high-speed accident.</p>
<p>Their line of forklifts is predictably robust and reliable. Crown Equipment Corporation released their first vehicles in 1956, making them one of the oldest businesses in heavy machinery.

All rough terrain forklifts have a backrest that keeps the load in place.
