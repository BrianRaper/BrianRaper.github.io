<p>If your service crew is already busy with the rest of your equipment, don't load them up with even more equipment to maintain. The lift truck market value and volume are contributed by the revenue and the forklift truck units sold across North America, Asia Pacific, Middle-East Africa and Latin America. If you're working outdoors, a gas forklift may make sense, but the introduction of the electric forklift has fundamentally changed warehouse usage.</p>
<p>Powered industrial trucks, commonly called forklifts or lift trucks, are used in many industries, primarily to move materials. We have a team of sales executives that are responsible for offering product information on our wide range of new Heli forklifts. Hand trucks lift the load a few inches off the ground, so they meant to be carrying things for long distances or extended periods.</p>

Advances in machinery made life easier for warehouse personnel; one of these important innovations was the pallet jack, which is basically a type of forklift. Many of the most serious forklift accidents happen when a driver drops a payload.</p>

<p>As the hydraulic jack at the 'tiller' end is raised, the links force the wheels down, raising the forks vertically above the front wheels, raising the load upward until it clears the floor.

Rough terrain forklifts typically have rugged tyres and feature heavy-duty construction.

<p>Pallet jacks are cheap, small in size, and good for small loads. Purchasing a lifted truck can be somewhat difficult, because these rare vehicles are hard to come by in some locations. They can handle anything from small single pallet loads to 40-foot loaded containers. Pettibone: Based in the United States, Pettibone rough terrain equipment is the result of customer input, largely designed and developed based on marketing research collected from owners and operators.</p>
