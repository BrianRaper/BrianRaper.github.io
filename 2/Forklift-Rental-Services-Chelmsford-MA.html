This Motorised pallet truck is used in several industries for lifting purposes and due to its long functional life.

Browse through the vast selection of machines that have recently been added to our inventory.</p>
<p>At least 22% of these deaths were caused by forklift overturns and another 20% to workers on foot being struck by the forklift.

Lifted trucks from respected companies like Rocky Ridge are the best option since they have experience and numerous positive reviews.</p>
