<p>In 1958, the first four-wheel drive rough terrain forklift was introduced. Once re-rated the forklift should have a new factory authorized specification plate, to replace the original plate, installed showing the new rating for the lift.

<p>It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable. These Class 5 forklifts, sometimes called Yard Trucks,” are larger when compared to a Cushion tire unit of equal capacity and offer a softer ride.</p>

Whether they be a factory-floor, rough terrain, or telehandler machine, forklifts often face far harder service than most farm machinery.

<p>Whether you're looking to buy a new forklift, rent compact construction equipment, or service an existing machine, everything we do is rooted in the highest quality.
