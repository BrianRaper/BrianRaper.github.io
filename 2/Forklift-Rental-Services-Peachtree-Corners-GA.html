<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks.

If the forklift truck in front is driving too slow. Handling processes will be slowed down, the equipment will experience increased wear and tear, and it may even suffer serious damage under excessive loads.</p>
