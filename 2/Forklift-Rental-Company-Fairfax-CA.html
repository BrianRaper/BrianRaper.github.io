<p>Forklift is a small industrial vehicle, having a power operated forked platform attached at the front that can be raised and lowered for insertion under a cargo to lift or move it. Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities. In the United States, approximately one person is killed in a forklift accident every 3 days on average. Therefore, the driving experience behind the wheel of cheap used lifted trucks for sale is unlike anything else. Class 4 forklift, primarily used indoors on smooth surfaces, commonly warehouse operations transporting 2,000 - 90,000lbs. Just knowing the challenges associated with a lifted vehicle can help you increase safety in and around your truck.</p>

We are able to meet your long-term and short-term forklift requirements whether you are based within close proximity to a major city or in a small town.

While gas forklift types do not need to charge and can operate day or night as long as they have enough fuel, battery operated forklifts need to be properly charged for up to eight hours to be used at maximum capacity.</p>
<h2>Lift On Truck Fairfax</h2>

Our nationwide used forklift sales network brings refurbished lifts to companies and agencies at reasonable prices.</p>
<p>This type of forklift makes use of pneumatic or air-filled tires, as opposed to counterbalance forklifts which use cushion tires.
