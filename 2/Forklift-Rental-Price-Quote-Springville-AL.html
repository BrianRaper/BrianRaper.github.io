We have both weekly and monthly forklift rentals available that are structured around our clients' specific needs. Used in different warehouses and go-downs, the offered pallet truck is known for its excellent load carrying capacity. While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>

Industrial and powered pallet jacks in general weigh more than standard light-duty models.</p>

Lifted trucks with a body lift have physical spacers or blocks installed between the body and the frame of the truck.</p>
