The ability to floor-stack a product is based on the stability of the loaded pallet combined with the product's capacity to handle the weight without buckling on itself.">

Generally, a lifted truck has the main frame and chassis raised up one or more feet above where it would normally sit on top of the tires.

In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>
