Reach trucks come in multiple forms, including the Stand-Up truck and Double-Deep truck. We teach forklift operators. Lift Code 4: Turret Trucks. Providing a standup platform rather than a seat allows for the reach truck's shortened length giving it its "tight access" capability. We offer lifted trucks across a variety of models and trim levels, so no matter if you're shopping for a baseline full-size pickup or an upgraded heavy duty model, you can secure whichever you need with a lifted upgrade.</p>
