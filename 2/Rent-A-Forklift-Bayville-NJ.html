<p>Layman's Terms: The panhard bar is a vital ingredient when lifting a truck, it helps the suspension not to twist and cause excessive body roll.

Additionally, buying your forklifts allows your drivers to get used to one vehicle, rather than learning how to use different trucks every few weeks or months.

Lifted trucks with a body lift have physical spacers or blocks installed between the body and the frame of the truck.</p>

<p>Aside from these two distinct types of a forklift, there are many other varieties available. Reach forklifts, also known as reach trucks, get their names from the distinctive way in which their fork carriages can â€˜reach' into racking. Low noise and vibration, excellent all-round visibility and easy servicing allow for improved driver comfort and forklift truck durability.</p>
