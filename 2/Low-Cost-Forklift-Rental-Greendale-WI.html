<p>Leading Manufacturer of hydraulic pallet truck, sewing machine lifter, wrap beam lifter, pallet truck, hand trolley and materiel handling pallet truck from Coimbatore. We have forklift hire & rental available for periods as short as a couple of hours and as long as up to five years. Acclaimed in the industry as a manufacturer and supplier, we are engaged in offering Semi Electric Pallet Truck from our extensive collection of products. By using the know-how gained from years of experience in production of industrial vehicles and the latest technologies, Komatsu markets a variety of lift trucks, including small-to large-sized engine-powered lift trucks, battery-powered lift trucks, and HST-drive lift trucks.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>

<p>Toyota forklifts stand out from the competition in one category. The term fork lift refers to a variety of motor-powered trucks equipped with lifting forks that are used for loading, unloading, and organizing materials that are stacked on pallets or designed for lifting with forks. This type of rough terrain forklift is vehicle-mounted and fitted with a telescopic boom lift, which allows this machine to pick up and transport loads at various distances and heights.</p>
<p>20. 20 Final Rule  OSHA published the final rule for Powered Industrial Truck Operator Training on December 1, 1998. The dual tires in the rear are as wide as the truck itself, and almost completely outboard of the body, so essentially it's like three trucks wide and three trucks tall coming at you. The optional light and fan package offers enhanced lighting on the operator's platform, allowing enhanced visibility when order picking.</p>

Among all companies, Toyota Material Handling currently holds the highest portion of the lift trucks market share. If you own your own machinery, our team of qualified mechanics will ensure that your material handling equipment is reliable and in safe working order.</p>
