<p>BJ's Rentals, Inc. The very basics of forklift driving and safety that apply to all forklifts will not need to be covered as much in this training course, making it slightly quicker than novice training. In England a 40-cell unit has been used to drive a forklift truck and to do electric welding. When you see a sharp increase in production demand or need to supplement your core fleet, forklift rentals provide a cost-effective solution to keep production moving.</p>
