<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.).

<p>Maintain forklifts in safe condition free of defective or missing parts through daily visual checks and regular preventive maintenance.

Do not elevate the load when the forklift truck is on an incline. One of the biggest perks of rough terrain forklifts is that they can lift big loads.
